The equation from \autocite{Einstein1924, Einstein1925} and \autocite{deBroglie1929}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bose_einstein_distribution}
	\expect{n}_\mathrm{BE}=\frac{1}{\expo{\beta \left( \epsilon - \mu \right) } - 1},
\end{equation}
was inserted with by using the short-cut \keys{cmd + n}, which gives a labelled "eqn" environment.
